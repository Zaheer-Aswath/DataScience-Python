This repository contains the projects I have done during my course of Intership with CodSoft

**Project 1 - TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION**
* Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
* The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.
