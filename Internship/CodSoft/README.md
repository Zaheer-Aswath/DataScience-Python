This repository contains the projects I have done during my course of Intership with CodSoft

**Project 1 - TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION**
* Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not.
* The dataset typically used for this project contains information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

* **Dataset from kaggle:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file/
* **Model used:** LogisticRegression

**Project 2 - IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION**
* The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
* Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

* **Model used:** KNeighborsClassifier

**Project 3 - CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION**
* Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
* Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
* Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.
