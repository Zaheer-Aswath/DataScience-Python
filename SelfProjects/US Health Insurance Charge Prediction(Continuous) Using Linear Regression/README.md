**Project Title:** Predicting Insurance Charges

**Objective:**
          Developed a machine learning model to predict insurance charges based on demographic and health-related factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status.
          
**Responsibilities and Achievements:**
**1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**

* Loaded and examined the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset/
* Checked for null values and confirmed the absence of missing data.
* Explored data types of each column for appropriate handling.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* Conducted univariate analysis to visualize the distribution of BMI, age, and insurance charges using histograms and boxplots.
* Utilized bar plots to analyze the count of categories in sex, smoker, and region.
* Investigated the impact of smoking and gender on insurance charges through bar plots.

**3. Multivariate Analysis:**

* Performed correlation analysis to identify relationships between numeric variables.
* Implemented Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models to assess the significance of categorical variables (smoker, sex, region) in predicting insurance charges.

**4. Data Modeling and Evaluation:**

* Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
* Trained a linear regression model and assessed its performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.
* Implemented Ridge and Lasso regression models, tuned hyperparameters, and evaluated their performance.

**5. Conclusion:**

* Summarized results and compared the performance of linear regression, Ridge, and Lasso models.
* Drew conclusions about the significance of different factors in predicting insurance charges.

**6. Testing with Sample Data:**

* Tested the trained model with sample data to demonstrate its predictive capability on new, unseen data.

**Tools and Technologies Used:**
  Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels.

**Outcome:**

* Achieved a predictive model with approximately 78% accuracy in estimating insurance charges.
* Demonstrated proficiency in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and implementing machine learning models.

**Relevance to Position:**

* Developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills through end-to-end execution of a machine learning project.
* Applied statistical and machine learning techniques to derive meaningful insights from data.
* Gained hands-on experience in model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
